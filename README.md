# python-API-challenge

1. Weatherpy

Here we check the weather of app.500+ cities using a series of successive API calls to openweathermap.org


Inferences from the Graphs: Temperature has strong correlation the latitude of a city. There is strong positive correlation in Southern hemisphere(when the latitude increases, the temperature also increases and vice versa), and strong negative correlation(as latitude increases, temperature decreases and vice versa) in the Northern hemisphere.

There is no indication of any correlation between humidity OR cloudiness with the latitude of a city.

Also, there is no significant correlation between wind speed and latitude, but wind speed appears to be a constant in the cities belonging in the northern hemisphere. 

2. Vacationpy

The objective of this assignment is to visualize humidity of cities using jupyter-gmaps and eventually determine the ideal weather condition for a vacation. Then we produce a list of hotels using the coordinates of of the cities in Google Places API , that are located within 5000 meters of the coordinates.
A few places that appear to be ideal as per this analysis are arraial do cabo, porto murtinho, itarema in Brazil and Savelugu in Ghana.
